                        BurgerExpress began its journey in 2015 as a humble food truck parked on the bustling streets of downtown. Founded by Jane Doe, a passionate chef with a vision for creating the perfect burger, BurgerExpress quickly gained popularity for its fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and friendly service.
